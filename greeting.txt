WELCOME to Wordle!!
It's the same as wordle except for some differences:
1. Type every guess in lower case
2. When you guess your word, if a '_' replaces a letter, that letter is not in the word
3. If a lower case letter remains, that letter is in the word but not in the right spot
4. If the lower case letter you typed is replaced with an upper case letter, then that letter is in the right place

ENJOY!!
